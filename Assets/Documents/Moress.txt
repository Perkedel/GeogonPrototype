Change your shape to do something!

Readme extended bellow:
This game was built under Unity. long short, it succ.
it shows terrible cannot be disabled without purchase of higher tier, Made with Unity logo.
Avoid at all cost!
Unity Pro is only available as subscription!!! no permanent single time purchase!
fck Unity!

If you want to develop AAA games, use Godot latest version instead! it is now has the similar or same Mono behaviour like the Unity. Yes, C# is available for Godot!
also you can use GDNative C++, or GDscript Python-like.

Godot is started as 2D. Unity was 3D.
Godot is native 2D. Unity is 3D locked in 2D.
Godot will have less resource compared to indifferent Unity's usage.

One day, Perkedel maybe use Godot to start their life of Hexagon Engine. They will create a bunch of prefabs like Controller, UI, Characters, and other fetishes (heartbeat, sexual, etc), and etc.
that's one of the possibility that Hexagon Engine can start.
But we're not sure. will it become the choice? we'll find out soon.
most importantly, we must have the game engine that emphasize freedom, all aspects of them. Gratis, Open Source, Full version!
pray.
